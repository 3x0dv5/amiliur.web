# License of the gitignore file
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/LICENSE
#CC0 1.0 Universal
#
#Statement of Purpose
#
#The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
#exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
#subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
#authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
#
#Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
#purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
#works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
#claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
#and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
#purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
#contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
#further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
#reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
#efforts of others.
#
#For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
#of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
#Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
#and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
#and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
#Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
#effect of CC0 on those rights.
#
#1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
#protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
#Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
#to, the following:
#
#  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
#  and translate a Work;
#
#  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
#
#  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
#  depicted in a Work;
#
#  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
#  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
#
#  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
#  a Work;
#
#  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
#  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
#  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
#  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
#
#  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
#  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
#
#2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
#applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
#unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
#and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
#known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
#action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
#duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
#extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
#copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
#commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
#the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
#detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
#shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
#any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
#by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
#
#3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
#judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
#shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
#Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
#is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
#non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
#unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
#the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
#provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
#in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
#purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
#promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
#of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
#License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
#applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
#invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
#affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
#Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
#and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
#Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
#
#4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
#
#  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
#  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
#
#  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
#  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
#  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
#  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
#  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
#  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
#
#  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
#  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
#  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
#  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
#  or other rights required for any use of the Work.
#
#  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
#  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
#  CC0 or use of the Work.
